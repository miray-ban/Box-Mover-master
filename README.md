## Introduction
The "Box Mover Master" project aims to address the challenges of warehouse automation by developing a robotic system capable of moving boxes efficiently and reliably. The robot uses sensors, cameras, and manipulation mechanisms to navigate the warehouse and handle boxes of various sizes and weights.

## Problem Statement
Warehouse automation poses several challenges, including:
- Efficient navigation in a dynamic environment
- Accurate object detection and identification
- Reliable box handling and transportation

The project aims to develop a solution that addresses these challenges, making warehouse operations more efficient and reducing manual labor.

## Proposed Solution
The solution involves developing a robotic system that integrates:
- **Sensors and Cameras**: For environmental perception and object detection
- **Manipulation Mechanism**: For handling and transporting boxes
